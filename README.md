## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my mentor Chris Quinn and my friend Ishan Sethy. The support they gave me were essencial for the development of this project. I also relied on the chat groups of the Slack community of Code Institute. 
In conclusion Javascript open my eyes despite at first the dificult to understand it, but eventually it made sence and I start to function in it.
